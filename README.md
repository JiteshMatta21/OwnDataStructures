# OwnDataStructures
The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of commonly used data structures by implementing them without relying on built-in libraries. This project will reinforce the fundamental concepts of data structures, improve problem-solving skills, and enhance proficiency in Java.

Linear Data Strucutres:
LinkedList Good alternate for array as dynamic in size and form with help of links. Linkedlist is chain like structure where each and every current node store the address for next node.
In linedkist, we store the data and address for next node in next node datatype. Linkedlist may two types singly and doubly where singly linkedlist nodes contains only address of next 
node address with data value of current node while in doubly linkedlist nodes contains address for both next and prev nodes with data valye of current node.
LinkedList is accessed by single master node called head of linkedlist.

Stack and Queue are two other linear data structures implemented using LinkedList and ArrayList, where a stack is based on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, and a queue is based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering of data. 
Both mainly have three operations, which include push, pop, and peek operations.
